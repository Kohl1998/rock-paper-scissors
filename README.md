# rock paper scissors game

## Description

For this application I built a simple application for rock paper scissors which could run in the browser. 

To play the game, the user is presented with a prompt that asks for their choice, and then they are alerted with feedback on the computer's choice. 

The total amount of rounds are 10, with the option to play again.

## Installation

I setup a remote repo on Github to work from, which I then cloned to my local repository so I can have the two in sync. 

Afterwards, I used vscode which is an integrated development environment which allowed me to update the software code, but also see the code in action using the live server extension. 

Lastly, once I was done I pushed all the updates to my remote repository from my local repo using commits, and once I was happy I deployed the changes to the live website.
